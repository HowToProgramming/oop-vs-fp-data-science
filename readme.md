# Object Oriented vs. Functional Programming in Data Science : Distribution

There are two interesting and most popular programming approaches in industry right now, which are **Object Oriented Programming** and **Functional Programming**. In this article, we are going to compare two approaches in Data Science, starting with **Probability Distributions**.

In this article, our objective is to create classes and functions to calculate the **Probability Density Function**, **Cumulative Density Function** and **Inverse Cumulative Density Function** of three Probability Distributions, **Normal Distribution**, **Student's t-Distribution** and **f-Distribution**. We will use both **Object Oriented Programming** and **Functional Programming** in this procedure.
